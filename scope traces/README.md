# Scope Traces
Acquired from a CHIP Pro and a Texas Instruments DIR9001 based SPDIF-to-I2S converter.  
DIR9001 traces are valid signal and can produce audible output with a DAC.  
CHIP Pro is currently produces inverted MCLK but some DAC datasheets state that MCLK phase is not important, only synchronization is needed.
For example:  
> The PCM1794 requires the synchronization of LRCK and the system clock, but does not need a specific phase relation between LRCK and the system clock.
